		<description>You forgot to mention www.wififreespot.com.  Of course like you say you have to find these spots and you need internet access to find these spots.  I found several libraries in FL to have free wi-fi and most public libraries have computers you could use to find the free wi-fi spots.  My favorite last year was a Long John Silvers in Pigeon Forge, TN.  We couldn't figure out why they had the service but we were grateful that they did.  

Thanks for the interesting post.

P.S. The link for the Passport America that I work with is www.passportamerica.com and not the one with the dash  between passport and america.</description>
