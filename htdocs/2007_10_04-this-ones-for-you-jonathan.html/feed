		<description>Just FYI - Texas Pete's Hot Sauce is often available in miniature packages at Chick-Fil-A.  I load a packet for each chicken sandwich I consume.</description>

		<description>That's so freaking awesome - thanks for that!  I hadn't even seen that and I check MSN for my "general" news ;)

See you in a week or so!  I'll let you know as soon as dates are finalized :)

		<description>Gentlemen - 
As I was diligently working in my cube I stumbled upon a link that could help you gain your internet fame.  Evidently msnbc (I know Ben is has a special place in his heart for the mass media, but...)is looking for the following:
Send us photos of your RV!!
Are you an RVer, living the RV lifestyle and enjoying the comforts of home on the road? If so, we want to see images of your ‘House on Wheels.’ Do you take it on long vacations, or just weekend camping trips? Send us your photographs and we’ll publish a selection of the best images soon.
Just go HERE: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20841912/

Figured you guys could send in some pics and share your story and BLAM! Famousness, all because of me and my incredible work ethic which pushes me to constantly deliver the best advertising information to largest company in America.

Love,
JLee</description>
