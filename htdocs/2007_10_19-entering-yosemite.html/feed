		<description>Haha.. sorry, my mistake, that was Yellowstone.  We'll be passing through the Yosemite area in a week or so, but unforunately it looks like we'll have to breeze through it.  Maybe we'll pass ways elsewhere! :-)</description>

		<description>Ohmygosh!!!! Guys, we were JUST in Yosemite National Park today! (Oct 21) We're parked in Oakhurst at the foot of the park entrance (High Sierra RV Park) and took a day trip in our toad (tow car). 

We loved Yosemite Valley so much, we plan to return with our RV Oct 24-26. Sounds like we *just* missed you!! (But, no cell or EVDO for us in the mountains either).

Hey, I hear ya on using gears to slow down - phew, gotta have strong arms to control all that weight/50' of motorhome &#38; toad.

Cheers,
Mari &#38; Ty - your fellow travelers (&#38; ultra vagabonds)</description>
