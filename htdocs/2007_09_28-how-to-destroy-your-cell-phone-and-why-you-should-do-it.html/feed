		<description>"I’ve been looking at this trip to push a lot of my boundaries…something to use in order to force myself to redefine various realms, definitions, and characteristics of comfort."

List of other things to put on the list:
Lug nuts
the letter "R"
The Beatles
throwing stars
16 guage insulated wire
packaging peanuts
Barry Manilow</description>
