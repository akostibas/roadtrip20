		<description>Better to happen at the beginning than in the middle of the Grand Canyon. ;)

Plus, it's electrical and every mechanic that's looked at it says it's in top mechanical shape so we're still hoping for trip void of other van issues.

		<description>You're probably right! I'm hoping that future problems will at least be more interesting even if they are as (or more) inconvenient :-)</description>

		<description>Not that I'm happy about this news, but I think this trip will be defined as much by what goes wrong as what goes right.  Those events are what make for good stories...I'd guess battery too BTW.</description>

		<description>Hahaha :-)  We actually talked about that, but I think AAA has something in the small print that made us rule it out.  You're right though, the tow truck driver did make for riveting conversation.</description>

		<description>That's pretty much what the guys in the tow truck said.  The shop didn't have a chance to look at it much today, but hopefully they'll get it operational sometime early tomorrow!</description>

		<description>Sucks.  Knowing very little about what's wrong, my bet is on alternator if it sounded like your battery was dead, and starter if it kept clicking weirdly and not starting but seemed like you had plenty of juice.
