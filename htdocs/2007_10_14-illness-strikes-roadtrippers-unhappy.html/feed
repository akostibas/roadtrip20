		<description>I second the recommendation for Zicam. PLUS, a totally magic little spray called "Wellness Shots" - get at any health food store. It has zinc, collodial silver, oil of oregano, ginger &#38; other good stuff. Brilliant. Even tastes good. About six sprays under the tongue and boosts the immune system BIG time.

Hope y'all are much better now tho.
