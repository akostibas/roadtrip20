		<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks! I was gonna put the stickers on when we were parked in Baltimore, but there were some guys playing basketball near by and I couldn't bear the nerd-shame at the time. As for Ben, you may just want to email him... ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>Busted. OK, I filled out the calendar with a bunch of our next stops, but since our schedule is so whimsical they'll probably change. As for my "pay day," it's not so glamorous! I've allotted $100/wk to non-gas expenses, and that's just up there so I know how long I have to stretch my dough :-)</description>

		<description>dude.  Your google calendar is empty except for reminding us that Alexi gets paid more frequently than most people and while roaming around the US in a van.  Are you trying to make us cry?!  I'm not participating with you.  You're not the boss of me.  *whine*</description>
