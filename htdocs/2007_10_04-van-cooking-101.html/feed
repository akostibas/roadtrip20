		<description>Guys, I feel compelled to tell you that ALL canned salmon comes with the bones in it. They are cooked and soft, look at it as more calcium for YOUR bones! Here is a recipe idea...mix it with some bread crumbs (no refrigeration needed), an egg or two (most stores sell them individually or get a 6 pack and you have breakfast the following day), some salt and pepper and some dried parsley and onion. Make them into patties, drop them in MORE breadcrumbs and fry them in a bit of olive oil. Call them salmon patties or croquettes. You can substitute crab meat if you prefer, but then they would be called crab cakes! Oh, and fee free to add a dash of hot sauce to either. ;-) serve with some lemon juice!
Bon apatit!</description>
