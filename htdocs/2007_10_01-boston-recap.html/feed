		<description>Hey! We slept in a Walmart parking lot in Framingham :-) It was really nice, actually, although I recommend if you move you do it into the city... it has a lot more to offer.</description>

		<description>Oooh! I'm so glad you guys had fun in Boston. Nimbit, the company I do most of my freelance work for is located in Framingham. If I was going to move from Austin, I'd totally move there. Good luck with the rest of the trip!</description>
