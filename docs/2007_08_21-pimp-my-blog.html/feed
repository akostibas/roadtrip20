		<description>It seems like it's working to me, but I might not be doing what you were doing.. The google map (at this point) is just going to have a bunch of pin-points of the cities we're visiting, so don't expect too much ;-)</description>

		<description>Hey...I tried clicking on your google maps to see your planned route and it said that the page couldn't be found.  Is it down at the moment or am I just proving to myself once again I suck at using the computer?!! 
It's a good thing I'm an IT recruiter huh!  =)

Thanks.  Can't wait to see your videos from your trip!
This is an AWESOME idea!  =)
