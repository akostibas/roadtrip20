		<description>Yeah, that's proving to be the case! Glens Falls and Chicago are the only places coming up where we know people.  Luckily our van is a "fully functional" living space :-)</description>

		<description>I imagine as you go out into the heartlands of 
America, you will run out of friends and will rely on your RV more. BTW, Grandpa suggests that you stop in Sault St. Marie on your way to the Motor City. As I looked at the map, you may be doing that anyway. Remember my suggestion to stop at a store before you park so that you can vary your diet.</description>
