		<description>Yeah, that stuff is nutty.  I couldn't help but think "So this is what you do when there's nothing else to do?"

Then I asked a grocery attendant in Montana what people do "out here."  She said they don't know which flows more; alcohol or the rivers.

We've also noticed a lot of casinos.
