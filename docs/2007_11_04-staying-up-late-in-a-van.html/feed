		<description>Is there a river somewhere you could park next to?  Perhaps acquire some government cheese.  This whole post reminds me of a Chris Farley sketch from SNL.</description>

		<description>Having went to 7th and 8th grade north of LA...i am very familiar with the homeless population.

i went to school in one of the old missons in Ventura. Across the street was a small park with a nice fountain. The homeless people (men/women) would sleep in the bushes and bathe in the fountain. we'd have PE out on the grass. one day while we were going over to play football, we had to do laps. Well, this one homeless dude was passed out along the "sidelines" and we started jumping over the guy. The best part was when steve scezzi went to jump over the guy and he put his leg up to trip him.

I think the best part of my athletic career was not scoring the game winner in OT while playing college hockey, but returning an INT for a TD while 7 drunken homeless people cheered me on.</description>
