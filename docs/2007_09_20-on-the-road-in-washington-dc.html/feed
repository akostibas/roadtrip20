		<description>Gary com'on...you see the budget they're working on.  They'd be better off sneaking into a field of cows at night and just have their way with the livestock.  Kind of like alien abductions, only with more alexi and ben penises.  BTW, THAT video would probably up your page visits!</description>

		<description>Hmm...an interview on beer making...and a night in a wal-mart parking lot.  Seems like you guys are going to set this country of ours on fire.  I think you need gimmick - something like: a mascot that you take pictures of in front of famous places, or you guys take a picture of yourself in a wild pair of boxer-shorts (only) in front of famous places...something that adds a bit of either danger or comedy...just a suggestion</description>

		<description>As far as places to go, I'd say to stick with the main stuff.  J could get lost in the Smithsonian for days, so be prepared for that ;)

We had lunch at G Street and 17th at a place called "Cosi" that was really good and really affordable.  We were all greatly impressed.

Can't wait to see you in Chitown!
