		<description>How the crap did you NOT know that freaking Ann Arbor Michigan WASN'T a party town!? Its only home to the second largest college in the US of A!  I hope that you do realize that Chicago is where "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" was filmed, that it's the 3rd largest Greek city in the world, and that there are at least 2 big ass Universities there...just a heads up.  Also, don't forget to call Austin.
