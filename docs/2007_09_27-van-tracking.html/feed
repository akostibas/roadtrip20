		<description>We barely stopped in NYC for a night.  If the weather's good tomorrow or Saturday in Boston, I'm taking it out.  It'll also come out in Chicago to ride with a friend of mine, so don't worry. ;)

		<description>Hey, did you realize (that if your current position on the map is correct) that you could go see baba's old aparment in NJ?  You could also go to the beach.  I hope you took the time to do these critical things.</description>

		<description>Nah, I think we're gonna head out early. Boston's a 4-5 hour drive, so leaving after would be way too late.  Give Obama our regards!</description>
